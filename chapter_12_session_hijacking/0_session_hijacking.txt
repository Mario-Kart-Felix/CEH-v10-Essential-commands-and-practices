Session Hijacking
    we have it because we don't want to enter username/password before all requests we send to the server!
        we need to keep a valid session during we are working on the server!
    It's like hijacking/using ATM just after someone entered their password!
    Hijack the session just after Authentication
    Can happen on network Level or Application Level
    People do not want to re-authenticate on every single HTTP/TCP request
        Applications do have persistence methods. Say Cookies, Specific URLs, Hidden form fields, session IDs, token, etc.
