Web Servers and Web Applications
    Purpose
        we have millions of websites around the world so they're so easy targets to hack even without any permission!
        it has different parts and details so it can help it to be more vulnerable ;)
    Details
        Admins or Admin area
        Databases
        Users
        etc
    Client-Server Architecture
    Web Servers
        Apache
        IIS
        Nginx
    Web Applications
        Types
            Browser-Based
                it's actually on the Server!
            Client-Based
                working by sending/receiving requests to/from the Server!
            Mobile Applications
                it can be even like a Browser to show you the content. you think it's a mobile app!
        Layers
            Presentation Layer
                user interface
                    what user see
            Logic Layer
                functional layer
            Data Layer
                the layer is implemented to work with the Database.
    Cloud Applications
        Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
            like the websites, you go to buy a VPS.
        Platform as a service (PaaS)
            like heroku.com to run your code. it has already all services and programs you need for your project!
            here, it's more secure because in the first one you need to do all your configuration and human misconfiguration increases, but in this one, you have a safe pre-configured platform ;)
        Software as a service (SaaS)
            like online Office, Google docs, and etc.
