Attack
    Anatomy of a Web Application
        some web pages that interact with the Server and Database to respond to the client!
    Insertion of characters into existing SQL commands
    Types depend on the Database, but ;.'"--,/*comments*/ are some of the breaking characters!
    Samples
        ' in username or 1=1
            SELECT * FROM USERS WHERE USERNAME='$USER' AND PASSWORD='$PASS';
                but attacker enter:
                    ' OR 1=1 ;-- (or 20>1 to avoid string matching/filtering in Firewall or something!)
                        it will login in this scenario!
                        or this:
                            or /* test*/ 1= /* test */ 1;--
    Return Types
        Error-Based
            if you will be able to create errors, you might see some information!
        Union-Based
            piggyback other data
                run a query to add some data and show once
                    like names with passwords and etc!
        Blind
            run commands without getting any output/result. sometimes attackers use the time to see if it worked or not!
            sometimes it may be dropped!
                ;(IF EXIST (SELECT * FROM users) WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:10'-)
        Avoid detection:
            by 20>1 instead of 1=1
            HEX
            spaces
            comments in the middle
            obfuscation
            etc
        How to attack?
            find a SQL path and try and try once you get in ;)
