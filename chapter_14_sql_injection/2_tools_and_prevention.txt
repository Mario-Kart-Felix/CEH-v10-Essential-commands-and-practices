    Prevention
        Checking/Validating all inputs
            URLs
            Post
            any other type of input!
        Using well-known libraries/components
        Firewall can send data to a Web Application Firewall/IDS/IPS
            like WAF in the Application Layer
        Have well-stored procedures and only answer via them
        Correct rights
            No need to run any system commands from the Database or give drop right to the Web User
            Separating access rules to different users, not assign all rights to all users or even one user!
        Logs
            Check all Log files to find who is trying to run a SQL injection attack or get access to the system or any!
        Backup
            always have backup files, but it can be dangerous if it can be leaked or be manipulated by the attacker ;)
