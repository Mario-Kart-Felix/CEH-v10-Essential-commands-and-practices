Waves
    Frequencies
        1Hz, 1KHz, 1MHz
        802.11
            2.4GHz, 5GHz
    Wavelengths
        length of one cycle
    Energy
        The amplitude or how tall the wave is
    Problems
        Path loss/free path loss
            because of its long length, it can lose energy
        lead
            something in front of the signal like a wall!
        scattering
        reflection
        fade
        long-range atmosphere refraction
        multipath
            the location we put it in the place!
                it can be different to send a signal to the receiver.
        noise
        etc
    RSSI (Received signal strength indicator)
        awful to high quality: -100 to 0
            when we contact to the service provider to check our network quality, they check this to check our line quality. the network quality icon on the system shows this number too ;)
    SNR (RSSI - Noise)
        it should be high to have more signal and lower noise ;)
    Frame types
        different than 802.3 (ETH) because we should have Collision Avoidance (instead of Collision Detection)
            Management
                SSID share beacons
            Control frames
                We send RTS (request to send) and will send we get CTS (clear to send)
