Standards and Regulations
    Layer 1 and 2 are important layers to us because after sending packets out of the network, regulation organizations see them and be careful what we are doing ;)
        Physical and Data Link
    IEEE working groups create these standards
        like 802.11 (have a look at the website)
            they might publish new features/updates on standards
    Some 3rd parties check device compatibilities by these standards  to give a certificate to produce a device with that compatibility
        like WIFI alliance for Wireless devices
    There also should be regulations on radios to prevent collision
        we can use all preferred/legal frequencies approved by countries or get a certificate for a frequency at our own 
            it's managed in the US by FCC and in Europe by ETSI
