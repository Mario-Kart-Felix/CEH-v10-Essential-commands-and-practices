        Start Wireless monitoring
            airmon-ng
        Discover the APs
            airdump-ng
        Wait for associations or use
            airreplay-ng
        Module 92 of CBT
        
        Commands:
            airmon-ng start <interface>
                start monitoring mode on the interface
            airmon-ng
                to see monitoring mode is enabled or not!
            airodump-ng <monitoring enabled interface>
                dump/see all packets are transferring around us. Hidden networks are included!
                some of them might have ESSID length of zero. it means they are Hidden networks ;)
                after a while when a device connects successfully to the Hidden device, we can see the name of the AP in the ESSID column ;)
                if we don't want to wait for a new device to make an association, we can send a Deauth attack packet to that MAC address to make all clients forced to do a new reassociation ;)
                    like this:
                        airplay-ng -0 <how many times you want to send a broadcast attack> <MAC address> <monitoring enabled interface>
                            now, all clients have to reassociation ;)
            airodump-ng -c <channel number> <monitoring enabled interface>
                like above for a specified channel number
    inSSIDer
        it can be installed to show you Wireless networks are there around you!
