MAC Filter
    Concept
        here we want to find the MAC address defined in the AP as a whitelist to change our MAC address to that MAC address to allow ourselves to be associated with that AP ;)
    Find the AP
        airmon-ng and airodump-ng
    Find an associated client
        airodump-ng
            to see what MAC addresses are connecting to that ;)
    Spoof the MAC
        macchanger
            now, you can change your MAC address to connect to that AP ;)
    Commands
        except for all commands we have seen in the previous video we only mention new commands:
            iwconfig <monitoring disabled interface> essid <SSID> channel <channel number>
                to test we can normally connect to that AP or not. to know it has an MAC filter configured or not!
            airodump-ng -c <channel number> -a --bssid <MAC address> <monitoring enabled interface>
                we want to find MAC addresses that are already connected/associated to the AP to change our MAC address to their MAC ;)
            macchanger -m <new MAC address you want to apply to your interface> <monitoring disabled interface>
                it changes your MAC address on the interface ;)
                before this, you should stop monitoring mode on the interface!
                after this, you should make the interface down and up again ;)
            Now, you can connect to the AP with a whitelist MAC address ;)
