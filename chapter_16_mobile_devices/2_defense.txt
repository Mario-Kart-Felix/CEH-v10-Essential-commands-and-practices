    Prevention
        Backup
            store your data somewhere else.
        Updates
            getting updates periodic
        Trusted sources
            only install Applications from trusted sources.
        Safe passwords/patterns
        Encryption
            Encrypt your files
        Signing
            install signed Applications
        Common sense
        ACL/Permission on programs
            check Applications Permission list
                deny if you think they're not needed ;)
        Isolation in extreme cases
            separate your phones/works/Applications/etc for different purposes/usage ;)
                for example, if you have to install an Application you are not sure about it, you can install it on a virtual machine/another phone.
