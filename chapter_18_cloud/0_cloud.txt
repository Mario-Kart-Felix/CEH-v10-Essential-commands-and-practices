Cloud
    It's in CEH Version 9
    The hypervisor can share CPUs, Memories, etc between Virtual Machines.
        here we have some problems known as OverSelling resources can use more than the amount we have!
    Cloud can provide VM, Space, etc.
    Cloud can be 3rd party or your own company.
    Benefits
        Self Service
            you don't need to think about:
                what HDD/SDD you should buy
                how you should configure them
                how you should secure them
                how you must maintain them
                etc.
                It already exists and is ready to use ;)
        Measured (pay as you use)
            prices are based on how you use it!
                you don't need to buy anything!
        Elasticity
            It can grow as you need new resources as your project grows ;)
                you can increase your Dockers as you need new ones!
            we something about this term called eDos ;)
        Pooling (sharing non-utilized resources)
            in Cloud services, providers sell services with more than physical resources to clients because they think that clients won't use all of their resources as soon ;)
        Network Access
            remote access is so popular and normal way to access them ;)
    Types
        PaaS (Platform as a Service)
            for example, we have an installed platform with all requirements to run Python projects with their Databases and everything may we need ;)
                we don't need to worry about installing tools and wasting time or even worrying about its security ;)
        SaaS (Software as a Service)
            like Office360 (It's fully online)
            like Google Drive
        IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
            like Storage, Computing, etc.
                Picture storing cloud or something.
                Cloud Computing platform
                    like AWS
            like DropBox
