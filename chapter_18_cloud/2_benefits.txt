Benefits
    You can rent high-quality/powered resources only for many hours/days for a low price!
    Most of the time, companies do have better securities measurements than us.
        also better devices and observations
            they sure have better Firewall, IDS, IPS, Routers, Servers, Cables, Teams, Technicians, and etc.
    Automatic scale-up
        get more resources without getting your permission each time it needs!
    Automatic scale-out
        get more servers while your server is under attack without getting your permission each time it needs!
    Most of the time, they do have DDOS defense!
        like Cloudflare (even if you get a free plan!)
    We will need fewer resources and just purchase them
        we don't need to hire a Security expert, Network/System admin, and etc.
    Easier Auditing
        legal and technical
            we need to pass/follow some Auditing rules if we have our infrastructure, but if we use Cloud services they had to pass/get all of them, so we have them by default ;)
    Easier disaster recovery
        make sure that your provider stores them beforehand!
            they sure have better solutions like weekly backups to restore data after a disaster happened ;)
                you have to test it and restore it to test routines, because sometimes they are only advertisements ;)
