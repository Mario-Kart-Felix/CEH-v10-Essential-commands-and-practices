Encryption
    Confidentiality
        keep it Secret
            others can't see it
    Integrity
        keep the message as when it was original
            it's not changed
    Identification
        we can decrypt the message with Bob's Key, so we can make sure it is encrypted by Bob!
    Plain text -> Encryption algorithm -> Cipher text
        like ABCDEFG -> Algorithm A -> hsdfu3gy23bwhbdj
    Keys should be secret, not the algorithms
        we should have a secure and safe Key prevent it from Decryption even if we know the algorithm!
            algorithms that don't have any Keys and they made by people personally are weak and not reliable!
                it's good when we know the algorithms, but we can't decrypt it because we don't know/have the Key ;)
                    like popular algorithms everyone use!
    Symmetric
        Key or Single Key, Secret Key, Session Key, Shared Key
            Encryption Phase:   Plain text  ->  with Key A  ->  Cipher text
            Decryption Phase:   Cipher text ->  with Key A  ->  Plain text
    Asymmetric
        Pair Keys
            Encryption Phase:   Plain text  ->  with Key A  ->  Cipher text
            Decryption Phase:   Cipher text ->  with Key B  ->  Plain text
    Steganography
        hiding something in something else especially in Pictures/Images
            it can put Data between bits of the file, but the Picture/Image can't be detected as a changed file with eyes!
