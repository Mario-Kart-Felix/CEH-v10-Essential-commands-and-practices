Symmetric
    The same Key is used for Encryption/Decryption
    Exchanging the Key
        An important problem in Symmetric algorithms is that we need a Safe/Secure channel to exchange the Key between two sides because both of them need the Key to encrypt/decrypt data!
    Block Cipher (block)
        it can encrypt input data Block per Block with the Key until the end of the last Block.
            sometimes, the last Block isn't equal to the other Block, so we will add some padding to make it a normal Block to encrypt!
    Stream Cipher (byte for byte)
        encrypt data as we come!
            like XOR
    Diffie-Hellman lets parties exchange Keys without exchanging Keys! (PSK)
        two sides of Encryption/Decryption don't need to share the Key!
    DES (Data Encryption Standard)
        It's based on Lucifer, it was very common in the 1970s.
        Block Cipher with 56 bit Key and 64-bit Blocks.
            3DES uses 3 Keys, 3 times to make it more difficult to break ;)
                finally, it's better while we are waiting for new algorithms!
    AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
        It's based on Rijndael
        Variable Key length can be (128, 192, 256) for 128-bit blocks.
    Concerns
        algorithms are only one part, we need other parts too!
            like DH
                check sslscan on Google and note that it even supports DES-CBC3-SHA
                    it can check the Cipher Suite
            Cipher block chaining is a kind of XORing each block with the previous one.
                they want to make it more difficult to break and reverse it!
        AES is still considered secure and attackers need side channel attacks to break it.
