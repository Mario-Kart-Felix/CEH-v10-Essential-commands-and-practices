Certificate Authorities
    Certificates are data structures that stores Keys (X.509)
    CA is a repo of certificates
        collecting data and issuing a certificate.
    CA and its systems are called Public Key infra (PKI)
    Anyone can create Certificates, but if you want to be on your Servers and recognized by others, you need to sign it by a CA
        (Trusted 3rd Party)
    Only the power will get the Private Key, but everyone can check the Public Key.
    Keys have fingerprints
    Generating Self-Signed Keys
        openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem
        openssl -x509 -in key.pem -text
    PGP (GNU - GPG)
        instead of CA, they use web of trust
            like MIT
        I upload mine, then someone who knows me, check my fingerprint and sign my Public Key, so his friends will know me!
        not good for Servers, but it can be good for people!
