Hashes
    Concept
        Plain text -> Hash Function -> Hashed characters
    Usage
        Authentication
            storing entered passwords instead of Plain text characters
                we can even add Salts to passwords
        Verification
        Integrity
            make sure about downloading files

    Features
        Oneway
            ABC is always a fixed output, but it can't reversible as ease ;)
        Easy to check
        Brute force is difficult
            it's difficult to check all Plain texts to find Hashed output ;)
        deterministic
            the same input always give the same output
        collision resistance
            it's impossible/hardly never to make the same output from two different inputs ;)
                some old algorithms might be vulnerable more!
    MD5 (32 HEX characters = 128 bit)
    SHA 1, 2, 3 (224, 256, 384, and 512 bits)
