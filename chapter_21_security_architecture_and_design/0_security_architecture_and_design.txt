Security Architecture and Design
    There are Protocols and Standards
    Design Concept
    Application Security
    Disaster Recovery Plans and Business Continuity
    Not data is created equal!
        you don't keep Secret your employees enter/leave data as equal as your biologic/drug formula or even your Source Codes ;)
        Plan for different levels:
            in Governments
                Top Secret
                    they can cause serious problems
                Secret
                    they can cause problems if others know that ;)
                Confidential
                    Secret things between Managers for example!
                Restricted
                    limited to the specific sections of the Organization
                Official
                    they are internal things in an Organization
                    usually, they're not so important, but they are not public too.
                Unclassified
                    everyone can see/access them
            in Companies
                Restricted
                    for special departments/sections
                Private
                    internal things
                Public
                    everyone can see/access them
    Security Models (who can perform what action on what data)
        State Machine
            Step-by-Step routines to finish it ;)
            very abstract
            evaluate when the overall state is insecure
            Models
                Biba 1975 (Kenneth Biba)
                    It's mainly about data integrity
                        everyone need to authorize so it's clear who accessed to what!
                    Both data and people do have classification levels, so people with some access levels still need authorization to modify data.
                        some people have some access to some data that need to authorize first ;)
                Bell-LaPadula
                    It's for military and governments and mainly about confidentiality
                        focus is on confidentiality, so system is in secure state all the time!
                    system can only be in secure states
                Clark-Wilson Integrity Model
                    It's not rely on state machines
                    No object and subject
                    it focused on consistency of data
                        only allow access through micro known programs
                            only someone can run a micro program to do only a thing on the machine, not anything more ;)
        Classifications change and they have expenses
    Conflict between Security and Business (CIA)
        routines should be normal, not so secure that none of employees can access to a simple data as ease, not very available that everyone can see/access it ;)
        Levels
            Confidentiality
            Integrity
            Availability
    Separation of duties
        two man control
            each tasks should be under control by at least two people ;)
        rotation
            rotate job/tasks to prevent detecting behaviors or any!
        mandatory vacation
            take them to vacation to change duties to detect any bad works ;)
        change control
    Logging
        to track everything
    How we handle Risks or Breaches
        quantifying Risks
            Measuring Attacks to know:
                what happened
                what is the risk
                what we loss
                what we should do
            Vulnerability -> Threats -> Risks -> Loss
            sometimes, they know all problems and only have a budget to fix some of them, so they must quantify them to know what has more priority to resolve ;)
        A Security control is a mean of Avoiding, Detecting, Counteracting, or minimizing security Risks

            guidelines
        Phases
            Identification -> Protection -> Detection -> Response -> Recovery
