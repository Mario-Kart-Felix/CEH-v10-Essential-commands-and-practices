privileges
legal operations should be keep in mind before starting hacking.
most concerns

hackers:
    hacktivist
    script kiddies
    suicide hacker

hack values:
    most important sections/area/sensitive in that organizations

vulnerabilities:
    weaknesses

exploits:
    successful attacks, executions on the target

payloads:
    sending crafted data on the target machine.

zero days:
    the security problems not published yet.

pivoting (daisy chaining):
    going through different machines to run a series of attack and get access to the specified server/machine.

doxing:
    publishing personal identification information

bot/botnet:
    running some attack executions on the infected machines.

------------------------------------------------------

reconnaissance (information gathering)
    passive (googling, news, whois, ip, host, archives, etc.)
    active (call and ask, visit there, etc.)
scanning
    which port is open?
    what os is used?
    what devices is running?
    what softwares are running?
    what vulnerabilities we can find on the targets?
    what misconfiguration problems are there?
gaining access
maintaining access
    rootkits
    trojans
    backdoors
    etc.
cover tracks
    logs and etc.
