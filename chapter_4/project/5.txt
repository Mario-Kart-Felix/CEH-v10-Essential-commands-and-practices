GitLab is built on top of Ruby on Rails using Haml and also a JavaScript based Frontend with Vue.js. Be wary of the limitations that come with using Hamlit. We also use SCSS and plain JavaScript with modern ECMAScript standards supported through Babel and ES module support through webpack.

Why we chose Vue.js
Why GitLab went with Vue.js

I had a great conversation with an interviewee a few weeks ago about how one should go about choosing a JavaScript framework.

He pointed out that when a major software company releases their secret sauce, there is going to be hype. Devs think to themselves, "That company writes JS differently than me, and they are prominent and successful. Is their way of writing JS better than mine? And therefore must I adopt it?"

Their secret sauce may be awesome, but don't assume awesomeness just because everyone else gets excited. You wouldn't copy and paste an answer from StackOverflow, without understanding it, so why copy and paste an entire framework?

Which brings me to our decision to use Vue.js at GitLab.
