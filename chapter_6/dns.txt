AXFR
    "DNS Zone transfer" sends DNS information from one server to another server to have HA (high availability)
    sync DNS servers
Windows
    nslookup
        > server ns.domain.com
        > type=any
        > ls -d domain.com
Linux
    dig domain.com axfr
    dig +short ns domain.com

if the main DNS server don't answer, we can get all subdomains from another DNS server:
    dig axfr google.com @dns_server.com
        you should ask a server that return all information about your target with AXFR option because some DNS servers don't answer to your request!

you can use DNS zone transfer to get all subdomains for the specific domain name to get a way to know how many services they have and what vulnerabilities there are :)
