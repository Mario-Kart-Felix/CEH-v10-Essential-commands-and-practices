    NetBiosOverTCP
        api that allows different programs in different systems to introduce themselves to each other.
    deprecated in linux, but it is still available in Windows.
information like computers, shares, services
you can check with nmap for netbios
    138, 139 TCP
    137 UDP
on Windows, you can test it with "nbtstat"
    -a for netbios name
    -A for ip
    -c show cache
suffix codes are in netbios and netbios over tcp/ip on wiki
on Windows "net view \\192.168.1.12" will show shares. this will connect with specific NULL session.
GUIs like "netbios enumeration" on sourceforge or "superscan"

NetBios is used to gather information from old networks and there is no usage on the new TCP/IP network.
maybe one day you can see it somewhere.
