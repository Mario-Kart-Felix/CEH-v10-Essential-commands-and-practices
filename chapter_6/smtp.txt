    SMTP 25
        simple
        enumeration
        commands
           HELO
           EHLO
           MAIL FROM
           RCPT TO
           SIZE
           DATA
           VRFY (check a particular email address is exist or not)
           TURN
           AUTH
           RSET
           EXPN (checking the identity of a mailing list)
           HELP
           QUIT 
    if there is no such user, we will get back an email with its headers and information
        send a fake email that you sure thats not available on the server to the mail server to check if there is an active mail server or not because if it returns a reply, we know that email address doesn't exist on the server so we can enumerate all active and exist mail addresses via brute forcing.
    telnet <server> 25
    search for SMTP commands (specially VRFY jadi, or EXPN jadi to check if a list of users are active on the server)
    smtp-user-enum
        to and email servers
    problem with open SMTP relays
        if a server is misconfigured and doesn't check/verify the mail server and the email server, someone is able to send a mail by the mail server as a regular user.
