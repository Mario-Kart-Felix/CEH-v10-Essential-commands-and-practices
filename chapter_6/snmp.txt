Concept
    port 161, 162 UDP
    OID (attribute name that you want to get)
        example:
            get one minute load of the CPU: 1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.10.1.3.1
    community string is like password to authenticate the request.
        example:
            snmp 192.168.1.12 1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.10.1.3.1 -c 46515fsf16f#KJfnkdf (sending clear text on the wire :D)
            you can see how easy and how old it is :)
            it was a simple way to control the network, but these days it's very important and useful.
    versions 1, 2, 3
On windows snmputil.exe
    get
    getnext
    walk
SNScan from McAfee, also checks network
    check all SNMP in the network and walk/watch them.
IP Network Browser (Solarwinds)
metasploit also has SNMP
    search SNMP and we will use snmp_enum
    use auxiliary/scanner/snmp/snmp_enum
    show options
    set RHOSTS 192.168.1.12
    run
snmpwalk -v 1 -c public demo.snmplabs.com
snmpget -v 1 -c "community" target_name_or_ip .1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.10.1.3.1

you can get all sub values by entering the top tree category value like .1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.10.1.3
    load.1 = STRING: 14.13516516
    load.2 = STRING: 12.16151651
    etc.
