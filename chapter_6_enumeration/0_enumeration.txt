Enumerations is he process of extracting information from a target system to determine more of the configuration and environment present. in many cases it is possible to extract information such as usernames, machine names, shares, and services from a system as well as other information, depending on the OS itself.

We will need active connection!

All devices do have info:
    Network resources and shares
    Users and groups
    Routing tables
    Auditing and service settings
    Machine names
    Applications and banners
    SNMP
    DNS, NTP
    Active directory, LDAP
    NetBios
    Default password BruteForce
    etc.

Here, in this phase we have active connection to the system to get information.
For legal test projects we should have contract to do this phase!

The information gathered during this phase typically includes, but not limited to, the following:
    usernames
    group information
    passwords
    hidden shares
    device information
    network layout
    protocol information
