Network Time Protocol
    UDP port 123
    works like a chain of clocks and gives all machines sae time.
    Time is important for DBs, logs, certs, etc.
    older versions of NTP will provide you the IP of the clients.
    
    tools
        ntpdc (cli, help, monlist)
        ntpdate (pool.ntp.org)
        nmap -sU -pU:123 --script=ntp-monlist 192.168.1.12
            check on nmap manual date

    by monlist we can get all IPs that are setting their time via the NTP server we are talking about if it is enabled on the server.
