Passive online attacks
    packet sniffing
        sniffer
            tcpdump
                only sniff the packets on the server, then download and read/open it manually in the wireshark to check and get information.
            wireshark
                graphical interface on the tcpdump/low level network interface (NIC)
        analyzer
            in the past they were hardware devices to connect to the network and show the packets, but these days they're as softwares.

        happens in one collision domain
            same IP range/network
        spoofing (later)
            like ARP spoofing to redirect packets to yourself
        
        best protocols for sniffing (they're clear text)
            Telnet, FTP, SMTP, rLogin, SNMPv1
    MiTM: man in the middle attack
        burp suite
        browser exploitation framework (BeEF)
        SSL strip
        MiTM proxy
            like burp to work as a proxy and recording the network packets.
    replay attack
        recording all send/receiving packets to play the game again and authenticate with latest packets if there are no any challenge/response mechanism.
