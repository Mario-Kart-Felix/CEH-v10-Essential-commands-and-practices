Trojans
    Wrapping malware with legitimate app (binding)
        as we said in the Introduction, like a normal program, but it has another part to do a bad thing!
        Like:
            unofficial download managers
            software extensions
            players
            etc
    RAT (Remote Access Trojans) can hide or covert on HTTP, VNC, ICMP, HTTPS, ... (page 349); we say all HTTP
        RAT, but be careful where you download and check md5s because even you as a Hacker can be a target ;)
        Firewalls will let outbound traffic!
            installed Trojans can easily connect to their servers from the inside, but you can't hack the machines behind the Firewall from the outside at ease!
        Firewalls don't prevent popular packets like HTTP or ICMP
            you can send your data as payloads in these types of packets.
                Tools:
                    Loki (send payloads via ICMP packets)
                    ICMP backdoor
                        like Loki, but instead of using Ping echo packets, it uses Ping replies.
                    007shell (uses ICMP)
                    Bock (uses IGMP not ICMP)
                    Reverse world wide web (WWW) tunneling shell
                        creates covert channels through firewalls and proxies by masquerading as normal web traffic.
                    AckCmd
                        provides a command shell on Windows systems.
                        under the right conditions, this software can capture passwords, confidential information and other data.
                    IKS SOftware Keylogger
                        Windows-based Keylogger
                        low-level and does not show up in the process list or through normal detection methods.
                    Ghost Keylogger
                        like the IKS, but send activities by encrypted email.
                    Spector Pro
                        capture keystroke activity, email passwords, chat conversations, logs, and instant messages.
                    Fakegina
                        very specific to capture usernames and passwords from Windows systems. it even intercepts communicates between the Winlogon process and the Logon GUI in Windows.
                    SEToolkit (Kali)
                        you can make your own custom RAT to send for different users and make them to run on their machines ;)

    Tools to create Trojans:
        LetMeRule
            a remote access Trojan authored in Delphi. it uses TCP port 26097 by default.
        RECUB (Remote Encryption Callback Unix Backdoor)
            borrows its name from the Unix world. It features RC4 encryption, code injection, and encrypted ICMP communication requests. It demonstrates a key trait of Trojan software—small size—as it tips the scale at less than 6 KB.
        Phatbot
            Capable of stealing personal information including email addresses, credit card numbers, and software licensing codes. It returns this information to the attacker or requestor using a P2P network.
            it can also terminate many antivirus and software-based firewall products, leaving the victim open to secondary attacks.
        Amitis
            opens TCP port 27551 to give the hacker complete control over the victim’s computer.
        Zombam.B
            Allows the attacker to use a web browser to infect a computer. It uses port 80 by default and is created with a Trojan-generation tool known as HTTPRat.
            Much like Phatbot, it also attempts to terminate various antivirus and firewall processes.
        Beast
            Uses a technique known as Data Definition Language (DDL) injection to inject itself into an existing process, effectively hiding itself from process viewers.
        Hard-Disk Killer
            A Trojan written to destroy a system’s hard drive. When executed, it attacks a system’s hard drive and wipes it in just a few seconds.
    They sometimes use Dynamic DNS to keep access in long term
        because when always use a static IP address or server to connect, it can be detected ASAP by everyone, but if you have configured a Dynamic DNS, it goes hard to detect and you can keep using it for a long time.
        plus, if you put a Static IP in your code, after you change your server you can't change it. so it's better to use a domain and Dynamic DNS.
    Botnets, Proxy Trojans, ...
