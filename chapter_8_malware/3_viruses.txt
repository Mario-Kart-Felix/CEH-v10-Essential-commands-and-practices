Viruses
    Self distributed (inects)
        it attaches itself to any other files to spread and run
    Sometimes transform to stay hidden
        sometimes viruses change a little bit of the file to change th signature of themselves and prevent Anti-Viruses of detecting them :D
    Mellisa virus infected about 20% of the computers at the time!
        it used email to spread itself.
    Anti-Viruses identify viruses in wild and add their signatures to their DBs.
        Heuristic
            newer Anti-Virus softwares are also checking the behaviour of the applications to identify viruses.
            Examples:
                access/change system files
                using network suspiciously
                removing files
                encrypting files
                connecting to remote locations
                etc
            adding unknown files to the checking list
                like VirusTotal
    Types
        system/boot sector viruses
            they write themselves on the first sectors of the disk. so the can run before windows and the can incept even passwords user enter ;)
        file viruses
            they store themselves on the files and attach them to the files!
        multipartite viruses
            infect both MBR/files
            two above types
        macro viruses
            writing script viruses as a macro in the excel, word, pdf, or some.
        stealth/tunneling viruses
            they can hard over original file to the Anti-Viruses. Anti-Viruses can only see/scan the normal part of the infected file.
        encrypted viruses
            they encrypt themselves to deny detecting methods.
        polymorphic viruses
            changing some parts of the virus. so Anti-Viruses can't detect them.
        metamorphic viruses
            reprogram itself :D
        cavity viruses
            overwrite the file on spreading to other locations. with padding or something.
        sparse viruses
            not every time
            sometimes do bad work as a virus and most the times do as a good boy :D
        shell viruses
            programmed by shell script.
    Why?
        Financial
            finding wallet address
            like a ransomware that wants to earn money
        Anti-virus companies earn money of detecting and correcting them
        finding data on other computers
        learning new things
        pranks
        hacktivists
        etc
    Fixing
        most viruses can be separated from the infected files because it's just attached to it and Anti-Viruses can correct/fix the file.
