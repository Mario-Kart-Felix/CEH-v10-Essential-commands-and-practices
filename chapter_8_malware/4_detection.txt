Detection
    Start with an updated Anti-Virus
    Start your machine Firewall
    Check below and search for unknown services/applications by tools like SysInternals. we can check these values once a week/month or etc to find what new software/applications/services is installed/used ;)
        Open Ports
            netstat -a -n
                to check all LISTEN and ESTABLISHED ports/services to detect suspicious services/applications.
            tcpview
            currports
            sysinfo
                System Drivers
                Environment Variables
                Print Jobs
                Running Tasks
                Loaded Modules
                Services
                Program Groups
                Startup Programs
                OLE Registration
                Windows Error Reporting
            etc
        Active Processes
            process monitor
        Registry Entries
            it's so huge. you should use tools like jv16, regscanner to save and track all changes of the settings ;)
        Device Drivers
            find strange or unwanted drivers
            tools:
                msinfo
                    can show drivers or even hide all MS ones (from view)
        Services
            find strange or unwanted services
            tools:
                msinfo
                service manager
        Startup Applications
            can start from different places so you can go with this tool to find all places can make an application Startup:
                sysinfo
                Task Manager
                security autorun
        Files and Folders
            tools like these will save and check hashes of files to know which files are changed after a while:
                SFC
                    Windows tool to scan and check files hashes to know which files are changed ;)
                SIGVERIF
                FCIV
                tripwire
        Network Activities
            you can save many hours of IDLE time of the machine by tcpdump or something. then you can check the access of different applications to the remote locations to find out any strange connections ;)
                normally, Trojans and ransomware programs works when you are not on the machine in the IDLE time ;)
            this happens a lot when you are compromised specially when protocol is used unusually:
                repeated ICMP with packet ID = 0
            we see this more on sniffing.
            
    After all, we are not try to fix an infected machine. we should reinstall everything from the scratch or a safe backup ;)
