File Verification
    Hashing
        Most download sites will provide the hashes on downloaded files.
    DNS Spoofing / DNS Cache Poisoning
    Hash will create a digest
    One way hashing
    Collision is difficult (two files/content with a same Hash!)
        hardly ever/almost never
    Types
        md5
        sha
            256
            512
            1024
            2048
            4096
        etc
    Why?
        it may not downloaded correctly and completely
        an attacker redirect you to download an invalid file from invalid sites/ISO file or something via DNS attacks ;)
