Sniffing
    Wiretapping on network
        we use the word sniffing because it's on the network!
    How?
        Passive
            only sniffing
        Active
            inspect packet and DENY/DROP it!
            manipulate it
            do a MiTM on the packets
        we have to be in promiscuous mode to read all frames (layer 2) and won't filter only for our own MAC.
            (ifconfig -a) will show if we are in promiscuous mode.
        MAC flooding (send too many to overflow the CAM)
            to bypass switch to fill the switch MAC table to get the packets of all machines!
        DHCP attack
        ARP poisoning
        DNS poisoning
        Spanning on switch
            port mirroring to get all packets of one port.
        HTTP, Telnet, Email, FTP, rlogin, POP, IMAP, etc.
        Software
            snort
            winpcap
            wireshark
            tcpdump
            etc
        Hardware
            protocol analyzer to sniff network packets.
    Detection
        Finding promiscuous interfaces using a Ping to unknown IP and MAC and seeing answers or using NMAP.
