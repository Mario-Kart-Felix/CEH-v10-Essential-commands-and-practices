Using a Sniffer
    Tools (pcap format)
        wireshark
            filters
                == (equal)
                != (not equal)
                contains
                    ip.addr
                    tcp.port
                    tcp.stream
                    ip.src
                    http contains
        tcpdump
            low-level sniffer can save/dump all packets into a file or even split them to a fixe-sized files!
            commands:
                tcpdump dst 4.2.2.4
                    only dump all packets with destination == 4.2.2.4
                tcpdump -w captures.pcap
                    writing dumps into a file.
                    with command 'file captures.pcap' you can find out which type of file it is.
