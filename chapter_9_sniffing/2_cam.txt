CAM table and Port security
    cam table came from Cisco
    macof utility from dsniff
        mac table flooding
            it's so serious and dangerous!
                it can break the network!
            macof -i eth0 -> will overflow the MAC and the next packets would be sent to all Ports to work!
        sending too many packets with different MAC addresses to the switch to fill/replace all MAC table records. so all old records will be gone ;)
            in old switches, when it doesn't know the Port with requested MAC address, it sends the packet to all ports to make sure it can be delivered to the destination machine, but in the newer switches it can be act like these ways we describe below:
    if we turn on port security on a Port, this will be resolved
        there are some steps when we get MAC address beyond our limit (say 5):
        P: protect
            it can accept only a few number of MAC addresses from each Port.
        R: protect + sending alerts and messages (syslog, counter, snmp, etc.)
            plus above, it will send a log!
        S [default]: shutdown the Port
            it deny/shutdown that Port immediately!
                don't play with this type of attack on the real network!
        S: shutdown the whole vlan
            so dangerous!
        How?
            to turn on Port security you will go to the switch and in config mode, will do a "switchport port-security maximum 5" on that Port and "switchport port-security violation restrict" and enable the feature "switchport port-security" and check with "show port-security".
