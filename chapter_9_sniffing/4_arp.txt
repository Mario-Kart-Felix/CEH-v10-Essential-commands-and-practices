ARP Poisoning/Spoofing
    Address Resolution Protocol
        The request will broadcast its MAC+IP toward 00MAC+IP.
            send Who has 192.....? Tell 192....
        everyone will check and if it's their IP, they will respond with their MAC+IP.
            192.... is at 08:2a:.....
    Problem?
        sometimes our MAC+IP is saved on the ARP table of other machines in the network. after a while, we moved our IP on another machine with a different MAC address. now, all our packets will send to the old machine with the same saved MAC+IP.
        What should we do?
            Gratuitous ARP is like tipping or proxy ARP.
                it sends a new message/packet that says "this is my new MAC+IP".
    How?
        First, we need to understand the ARP.
        The attacker will send gratuitous to router with its MAC and target IP and another one to the target, telling it its MAC as routers IP.
            (this is my new MAC+IP)

    We can also do a MAC spoof!
        we can attack by sending a packet to machines and say that my MAC address in the new MAC address of this IP address we mention in the command to become someone else:
            arpspoof -i eth0 -t <target machine/user> -r <default gateway IP>
                it sends the machine MAC as the MAC of the default gateway IP address.
    Defence solution
        ARP inspection
            header and payload verification to check all Source and Destination parameters.
            ARP ACL
                access lists from DHCP who knows which IPs assigned to which MACs.
